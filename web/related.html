  <p>
    The <a href="http://axiom-developer.org">Axiom</a> computer algebra system
    has been in development since 1971.  It provides the strongly typed
    programming language SPAD which is very well suited for the purpose of
    developing generic mathematical algorithms.  The current system boasts over
    1000 domains and categories providing a rich hierarchy of mathematical and
    general purpose objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to Axiom, there are two
    forks: <a href="http://fricas.sourceforge.net">Fricas</a>
    and <a href="http://www.open-axiom.org">OpenAxiom</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.aldor.org">Aldor</a> compiler (originally known as
    A<sup>#</sup>), was originally intended to provide an improved library
    compiler for the Axiom system, but eventually grew into an independent tool.
    Aldor provides several features which are lacking in SPAD, and a significant
    amount of code has been written using the system.  Unfortunately, the
    compiler is distributed under a non-free license.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Comma project borrows the fundamental constructs from SPAD and Aldor.
    However, it is not an attempt to clone or replace either of them.  Rather,
    it is an effort to broaden the language family and to provide a free, high
    quality compiler in the process.
