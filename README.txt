The Comma Project: http://www.nongnu.org/comma

Overview
--------

This directory tree contains the source code for the Comma compiler, various
documents describing the system, as well as the project website.  The contents
of this distribution are licenced under the MIT license (also known as the Expat
license) -- see the file LICENSE.txt for details.

The Comma project consists of two main tasks:

   1) Writing a specification (the Commaspec) for the Comma programming
      language.

   2) Implementing a compiler conforming to the Commaspec.  This effort uses C++
      as the implementation language and interfaces with the LLVM system
      (http://llvm.org).

This project is in the planning/alpha stage.  The code and documentation, as it
stands, is not complete or functional.  If you are interested in developing the
system, the projects homepage provides links to the appropriate mailing list.
